## Instagram's KPI And Experimentation

### Describe the user journey of the things you loved about it from the moment you started using it to your use of it now
I have been using instagram for more than 10 years now, probably when it just started. As a user I have seen it's tremendous growth in terms of number of user, number of features, and platform engagement. When I first started using it, I found it very different and interesting as compared to the other apps I used which were Facebook and Orkut (Not sure if snapchat was already there). It was fun to share just photos. Instagram also had the feature that showed followers activities. I loved the feature. It was just so interesting to see what other people are up to (Am I a stalker :P). That was my starting point. Cut to 10+ years later, Instagram has me hooked for completely different reasons. I barely put up any stories or posts. Most of the time, I am just scrolling through reels and sharing it with my friends. It has turned into some kind of love language for me. I feel like Instgram has got most of the things covered but if I had to run some experiments, here are some that I would be interested in checking.

### Experiment 1: Highlights Section Personalization
#### Objective: 
Currently, Instagram users can organize their stories into Highlights, but they are usually displayed in a linear order. This experiment would test a personalized algorithm that places the most relevant or popular highlights at the top of a user's highlights section. The goal is to see if this feature improves the likelihood that users will interact with their highlights more frequently.

#### Null Hypothesis: 
Personalized story highlights do not increase user interaction (views, engagement) with Story Highlights.

#### Alternative Hypothesis: 
Personalized story highlights will increase interaction (views, engagement) with Story Highlights.

#### Leading Metric:
- Number of views on Story Highlights.

#### Lagging Metric:
- Increase in user engagement with Highlights (shares, reactions, comments).
- Frequency of users revisiting and interacting with their highlights.

#### Test Cell Allocation:
- 50% of users will see personalized highlights.
- 50% of users will see highlights in the default chronological order.

### Experiment 2: Changing Feed Ads from Static to Interactive Content
#### Objective: 
Instagram could test transforming static feed ads (e.g., banner-style ads) into more interactive content, such as ads with shoppable features or a small poll/survey embedded. The goal is to see if interactive ads boost user engagement with ads and lead to higher conversion rates.

#### Null Hypothesis: 
There is no significant difference in user engagement (clicks, interactions) and conversion rates between static ads and interactive ads.

#### Alternative Hypothesis: 
Interactive ads lead to higher engagement and conversion rates compared to static ads.

#### Leading Metric:
- Number of interactions (clicks, polls) on ads.
- Number of purchases or sign-ups made through the ad.

#### Lagging Metric:
- Increase in conversion rates (purchases, app installations, subscriptions).
- Retention of users interacting with ads (e.g., frequency of returning to the app after engaging with an ad).

#### Test Cell Allocation:
- 50% of users will see interactive ads.
- 50% of users will see static ads.

### Experiment 3: Improved Shared Posts View - Scrollable Feed for Shared Posts
#### Objective: 
Currently, when someone shares posts with a user via Instagram Direct, the user has to open each post one by one to view them. The experiment is to allow users to scroll through shared posts as a continuous feed (like browsing the main Instagram feed) without opening each post individually. The goal is to see if this new method increases user engagement and improves the experience of interacting with shared content.

#### Null Hypothesis: 
Allowing users to scroll through shared posts will not significantly improve user engagement compared to the current method of opening posts one by one.

#### Alternative Hypothesis: 
Allowing users to scroll through shared posts will increase user engagement with shared content, resulting in more interactions (likes, comments) and more frequent sharing.

#### Leading Metric:
Number of interactions (likes, comments) on shared posts after implementing the scrollable feature.

#### Lagging Metric:
- Increase in the number of posts users share with others.
- Time spent in Instagram Direct by users after sharing and interacting with posts.

#### Test Cell Allocation:
50% of users will see shared posts in a scrollable feed.
50% of users will continue to open shared posts one by one.
